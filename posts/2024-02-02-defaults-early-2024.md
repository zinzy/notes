### In addition
#### Identity
This category may sound strange to you. Yet, as a Black person who grew up in a white environment, I have to make a proactive effort to find community among people whose stories resonate with mine. These are spaces that help me do this:
- [Bar Bario](https://barbario.nl/)
- [Omek](https://myomek.com/)
#### Hardware 
- [WH-1000XM4 Wireless Premium Noise Canceling Headphones](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b)
- (What brand is that reading light again?)
- I use a knock-off version of the [Roost laptop stand](https://www.therooststand.com/). I'd share a link, but I got it for free from a hostess at a coworker space, who took it straight from the Lost & Found. The knock-off is perfect, and has convinced me you don't need to buy the actual Roost one.
#### Kitchen
- I've inherited Anja's kitchen utensil snobbery and have become a big fan of[ Le Creuset's silicone spatula series](https://www.lecreuset.com/kitchen-tools/spoons-and-spatulas). I wouldn't know how to cook a proper meal without them.
- Our best and most-used knives come from [Karasu](https://karasu-knives.com/) in Amsterdam
#### Wear & care
- Over the Summer, I got myself a [Nike Sportswear RPM Waistpack](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/t/sportswear-rpm-waistpack-CNTh3z/CQ3817-010). Fanny packs are notoriously sizeist, but luckily this pack's extra belt makes for a create extension, giving me the support I need.
- I use the following products of Yari's Green Curls line quite religiously: Moisturizing Shampoo, Hydrating Conditioner, Deep Treatment Mask
### Wellbeing
- [Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask with Nosepiece](https://nidragoods.com/collections/sleep-mask-collection/products/nidra-deep-rest-eye-mask-black)
### Yoga
- Yogitri ECO Buddhi eye pillow with lavender-scented flax seed, used for savasana
- Yogitri ECO Pratyak bolster
- DoYourYoga half moon meditation pillow
- YogaTimer
- (I have an excellent mat that I'm trying to identify on the Internet)
