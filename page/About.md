Hello, I’m Zinzy Waleson Geene (she/they) and this is my personal website; a quiet street on the Internet where I come to link and think. It’s a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. On this website as well as in life, I aim to bring my whole self: the self that works, plays, questions, doodles, fears, cooks, prays, gets angry, changes her mind. I write about my [interests](/interests) and what I'm up to [now](/now).

During office hours, I work as a senior researcher and designer at [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl/). After 17 years in the industry, I'm pleased to have entered healthcare technology, where the business rules are intricate, the problems serious, and the people in it with their full heart. You may be interested to read more about my [work](/work).

As you can see, I like to laugh a lot.

I'm of São Toméan and Dutch descent and live in Amsterdam, though I grew up in the vastly different-looking and different-feeling Dutch South, where it felt like I was on the sideline of life. Every day, Amsterdam reminds me how important it is to recognize myself in the people around me.

Together with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55) and [Lemonade](https://lemonade.waleson.us/) I share a small shoebox on the East side of the city. We are [child-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_childlessness) and vibing hard.

As a person of color who is queer, progressively Christian, and neurodivergent, I recognize that I need to make serious efforts to find communities of kinfolk. I'm an amateur facilitator building spaces for queer people (of color) at Queer Salon and QPOC Reading Club. At work, I started the Neurodiversity Club. In addition, I'm helping to build a truly inclusive, anti-racist, and affirming fellowship at [All Saints Amsterdam](https://allsaintsamsterdam.church/).

I'm an amateur musician and enjoy writing and singing music. We share our home with three guitars, a piano, and a few other sound makers. In various forms and frequencies, I've been keeping a diary since I was a little girl. In a way, this website is very much a part of that. I'm an advocate for the IndieWeb, which is a snooty way of saying I think the Internet should be scattered, playful, experimental, personal, and cozy.

My Xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. 

I've been sober since May 2018.
