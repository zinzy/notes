Hello, I’m Zinzy Waleson Geene and this is my personal website; a quiet street on the Internet where I come to link and think. It’s a home for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. You’re warmly invited to [say hello](/hello).

On this website, I aim to bring my whole self: the self that works, that plays, that questions, cooks, prays, gets angry, changes her mind. I write about my [interests](/interests) and what I'm up to [now](/now). I'm an amateur musician and diarist, as well as an advocate for the IndieWeb. This website is in constant flux, so much so that versioning it is a silly pursuit.

My xhosa name was inspired by Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindziswa. I'm a mid-tier millennial born and raised in the Dutch South. I came to Amsterdam a decade ago, and share a small shoebox on the East side with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55) and [Lemonade](https://lemonade.waleson.us/). We are [child-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_childlessness) and vibing hard.

Obligatory millennial tags: I'm a non-binary lesbian using she and they pronouns, and I'm neurodivergent. I've been sober since May 2018.
