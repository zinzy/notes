title: I'm neurodivergent
share: true
---

Like many other people in the world, I fall under the neurodivergent umbrella. I know there are various ways of looking at what falls under it and what doesn't, and that, too, goes for the label with which I come. I don't enjoy using the label itself, so instead I'll share something about what it means for my life:

- **I like a puzzle:** I'm blessed with complex curiosity, an appetite for learning, a deep love of problem solving, and an everlasting supply of questions
- **I'm a skip-thinker, an analogical thinker, and a meta-thinker**, which makes the previous point even more fun. Things make more sense for me top-down and with a good visual
- **I live with intensity**, which affects the speed at which I do things, which in turns impacts how I navigate relationships, how I handle tasks, and how I connect with the world around me. "You talk too fast", "the world is too slow" is a monotonous exchange in which I engage at least twice a week.
- **I'm intrinsically motivated**, which is great when I want to get something done, but not great when I don't.
