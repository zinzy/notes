## Quotes

- For many people today, the Gospel of John is the gospel that separates, excludes, defines, and demands. Jesus’ words, “I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father except through me,” claim that Jesus Christ is the exclusive way to salvation.
- I still struggle with how to teach and preach the language of hatred also prominent in the gospel and how to take seriously the potential for violence the language can provoke.
- I see clues to a vision of open community. The vision pushes beyond even some the boundaries very soon to be set up and reinforced by the church and presses against the limits on ecstatic vision and prophecy that some Christian leaders recommend.
- “expansive” reading of John.
- In chapter 4 I will wrestle with the most difficult challenge
- to an expansive reading of John—the negative portrait of the Jews and the language of hate and opposition of the world and God.
- It understands the author of John, not as a named apostle, but as a leader or leaders of a community, drawing on the tradition of the disciple whom Jesus loved but does not name, who tell the story of Jesus and of themselves.
- Finally it conceives of the history reported by the gospel to be the story of Jesus told and retold by a community who elaborates upon that history as time passes and who rethink and retell Jesus’ words and deeds in light of their sense of his ongoing presence with them.
- The gospels that came to be known as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were composed by anonymous authors from traditions about Jesus in the decades following his death
- The “Scripture” read by believers in Jesus was the Hebrew Bible in its Greek form, the Septuagint.
- In the first half of the second century (100–150 CE) from what we know, it appears that the Gospel of John was valued not so much
- among those writers who shaped orthodoxy, but by those Christians whom the orthodox writers later strongly opposed, the Valen-tinian Christians.
- I will point out where John’s perspective is not in strict harmony with the perspective of developing orthodoxy,
- In fact it is unlikely that these decisions were made in meetings; it is most likely that certain writings gained their authority by their circulation and use by Christian communities.
- “Yes, it’s OK. There must be more than one, and there cannot be more than four.” The classic explanation of this fact of four gospels is made by Irenaeus in the second century:
- Modern scholars use the term “synoptic” for Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
- When they commented on the gospels, the church fathers noticed that John fit awkwardly with the others. On first glance, John was the “black sheep” of the gospels, and the church fathers had to explain how it properly belonged among the gospels. However, as the reputation of John grew and it became a valued source for doctrine in later church writings, the misfit gospel became the one which encompassed all.
