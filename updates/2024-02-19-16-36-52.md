Jodie Foster has long been my favorite actress. Perhaps initially because *The Silence of the Lambs* couldn't have made a bigger impression on me. Later, likely, because I thought she was cute. Now, though, I'm impressed by her reflections on life, as well as her incredibly long career, and how it must have shaped a young child into a lonely woman.
